The question of the hour.  At 27 years old, I have made a pivotal choice to begin a course in software programming while maintaining a full-time position.  Although this career path steers left from my professional background, sports psychology and business, there have been a few signs and people who have led me to software programming.  Currently, I work as an executive assistant for the CTO and CRO of a digital publishing company.  While working considerably close with the CTO and his engineering team, I have been exposed at great lengths to team assignments and understanding the collaboration between team members. 

As I planned and attended team off-sites, their work began to spark my interest and questions began to surface.  I had always been intimidated by computer engineering, not only because of the black screens and characters seen on one's computer, but because I did not see many women working within this field.  The amount of women working on our team, 6, truly established an open forum for me to ask questions about their journey, day to day responsibilites,  and the obstacles they had overcome.  While away at one of the team hackathons, I began an introductory code academy course for a hands on experience to see if this could be a career I wanted to pursue.  After a few weeks, I begin to poke around with more questions, wondering the differences between software languages, and career trajectories.  If it wasn't for my position, the transparency of the team, and understanding that engineers actually work collaboratively vs. individually, I would not believe this career path would be as achievable. 

At this time, front end computer programming is the direction I would like to pursue.  I enjoy the creativity, design, and collaboration that this role requires.  When I was younger, I used to collect housing floor plans, blueprints, and play online Sims to build and recreate whatever image I had in mind.  By building websites I would be able to create something from scratch, which seems quite fitting as it was always satisfying building floorplan and design projects. 
Software engineering would instead enable me to create beautiful things that people interact with on a daily or weekly basis while learning to maintain them overtime in parallel with ever changing design. 

As a woman in tech, we are needed more than ever.  I once thought this was a very intimidating career, although it still is, it is something I look forward to stepping into.  Software development is a growing field, I want to be a leader in building efficient and beautiful things, work with talented people, make a good living, and share my journey with others.
