For this project, deciding the subject matter of my scraper was the most important as I wanted to have fun and learn something relating to my passion along the way!  As new diet and food trends arise, I am always curious to learn more about what they entail and how they may effect the human body.   My roommate recently “ate for her blood type” for 30 days, sparking my interest to scrape a website reviewing the blood type diet. 

Now that I have a topic and a webpage…where do I begin?  Starting with a blank terminal was quite intimidating, thankfully the video resources were a great guide to a step by step tutorial and a launchpad for beginning my project.  The easiest way to build my CLI was to outline what I wanted my code to output, then building the data flow. I jotted the information into the read.me and then hard-coded into my CLI file, just so that I could visually identify my expectations.  About half way through my project, once I started building the methods… I hit a wall.  I toggled back and forth between youtube videos and honestly this may have created more confusion for me, rather than sticking to one video through completion.  After a few days of wrapping my head around the different ways of completing this project, I realized there are always multiple ways to complete an assignment and I needed to stick to one format… for now, at least until I had more experience under my belt.  Alright, I was back on track! 

The program would first output the four different blood type groups, prompting the user to enter their blood type name to provide a short description, and lastly asking the user if they would like to see a 1-day sample menu.   A challenge I came across, was that I  initially thought I chose a simple site to scrape, but as I dug deeper into code, the formatting was tricky to gather due to funky labeling funneled between drop-down menus, which was different than what I had learned in our previous labs.  I would be unable to access the sample menus through attribute accessors, instead having to scrape the data, iterating over each section and then parsing it into hashes.  With racking up the nerve to ask for help from my fellow cohort, deleted code (which I thought was saved), rewatching youtube videos, and trusting in myself through trial and error… I completed my first Flatiron School,  Ruby- CLI Data Gem Project. 

Thrilled to have completed my first project, I continuously reminded myself that learning is the number one goal, not building the best program, or being hard on myself that I did not have the best code.  I believe the fog will clear up and it is all part of the process.
