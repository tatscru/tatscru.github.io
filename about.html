<p>Here we go, I have launched my first web application… making progress! </p>

<p>Concept </p>

<p>Coming up with a project idea was the least of my worries.  Living in NYC, it feels as though there are endless opportunities for activities, but even more so, food options! I wanted a place where local friends and community can share food recommendation in Brooklyn, NY- without having the endless options of Yelp. More importantly, in NYC, brunch is the top recommendations people are scoping out.  Although, brunch in NYC starts at either 1 or 2pm, which I still do not seem to understand, it is a top reason to spend an adventurous day with friends, in the best borough around.  Glad we are on the same page :) </p>

<p>Tests/Planning?</p>

<p>Outlining my project, on paper, was the best thing I could have done to better pinpoint what I wanted to create… and more importantly, the how.  For my CLI project, the first project submission with Flatiron School, two things had stumped me:  where do I even begin with this blank black screen and what did my mental diagram look like on paper?  This was crucial, especially when we are first building understanding of concepts- ideas can get lost in between ours ears, quite easily. Some of the hurdles I had to jump, when building this project, were crossing off each concept (CRUD)once it had been completed, a handful of trial and error, not feeling guilty for referencing previous labs (this is all part of the learning process), walking through my code with someone else, and remembering that I can always come back to to my project to make edits and design updates :) </p>

<p>Assessment Requirements:
<br />* Build an MVC Sinatra Application
<br />* Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra
<br />* Use Multiple Models
<br />* Use at least one has_many relationship
<br />* Must have user accounts- sign-up/login/logout. 
<br />* The user that created a given piece of content should be the only person who can modify (edit/delete) that content</p>

<p>Improvement Areas</p>

<p>* Add-in flash error messages 
<br />* Ability to upload to Heroku 
<br />* Design updates (Better knowledge of HTML/CSS or Bootstrap)
<br />* Ability to add photos/comments from other users (Similar to Google reviews/Yelp)</p>

<p>What I learned</p>

<p>Building the Sinatra Application really showed me the nitty gritty of building a web application!  I have seen quite a bit of improvement and understanding since my last project, but overall I am way more knowledgeable about coding just within these past 4 .5 months in the Flatiron Web Development Program.  Although this project did require any fancy front end design, with the little bit I know, it sparked my interest to learn more about Front End Web Development.  I have been working full-time, training a new hire, and helping plan my best friend’s wedding so all in all I am very proud of this project and how I have somehow managed my time!  Patience, practice, talking out code, and having a better understanding of how to read error codes is key and I look forward to project number 3.
